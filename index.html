      <h2>The story of drone strikes in Pakistan</h2>
      <ul>
       <p>Points to research/present:

<h3>1. Introduction </h3> 
Who created it? 
When?
Intent/objectives (choice of name)
  - illustrate the attacks by the drones. 
-  emphasis on the victims.
Type of visualization techniques used 

<h3> 2. Subjectivity </h3> Is the intent political? If yes, does that affect the way story is being told?
(This project helps to bring light on the topic of drones. Not to speak for or against, but to inform and to allow you to see for yourself whether you can support drone usage or not.)  But the description says otherwise *conflicting statements*

<h3> 3. Target/ Audience </h3>

<h3> 4. Pros and Cons </h3>
Pros: What it does really well?
<br>

Cons: Where does it fail?
<br>

<h3> 5. Limitations </h3>

<h3> 6.Data source </h3> 
Government data vs. NGO collected data
