<center><h3>1. Introduction </h3> 
Who created it? 
When?
Intent/objectives (choice of name)
  - illustrate the attacks by the drones. 
-  emphasis on the victims.
Type of visualization techniques used 

<h3> 2. Subjectivity </h3> Is the intent political? If yes, does that affect the way story is being told?
(This project helps to bring light on the topic of drones. Not to speak for or against, but to inform and to allow you to see for yourself whether you can support drone usage or not.)  But the description says otherwise *conflicting statements*

<h3> 3. Target/ Audience </h3>

<h3> 4. Pros and Cons </h3>
Pros: What it does really well?
<br>
List incidents chronologically

Convey a message regarding the shear of each incident
Allow for comparison within incidents
Cons: Where does it fail?
<br>

<h3> 5. Limitations </h3> 
No geographical reference (example: https://googletrends.github.io/year-in-language/ )
<h3> 6.Data source </h3> 
Government data vs. NGO collected data
Verified vs. observed/reported

<h3> 7.Accessibility  </h3>

<h3>8.Interactivity </h3>
Meant to interact with user, by hovering over the lines/traces we could read more data/ details of the incident. 
Changing color when selected, encouraging interaction and discovery by users to better explore the data themselves. 
<h3> 9.Design language </h3> (color, fonts, illustrations) 
Graphics: Clean and Simple
Choice of color
